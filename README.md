- 👋 Hi, I’m @Saigoninho.  I was once a programmer for about 10 years starting from when I was about 14.  I haven't coded in the last 15 years as I was burned out and wanted to pursue other interests.  I'm looking to return to software development at the age of 45 and I am more excited than ever.  Considering how much has changed, I am having to relearn everything   
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, robotics, and also finding ways to leverage software towards sports, gambling, and the stock market
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and dabbling in machine learning fundamentals
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve interests I listed above
- 📫 How to reach me: tungmtran@gmail.com
